        description: "With over 9 years of dedicated experience in education across primary and secondary schools, Krishna embarked on an inspiring journey that led to the creation of The Bee's Knees Forest School. The defining moment occurred in 2015 when the concept of 'democratic education' ignited a passion for offering students the power to choose what they learn.<br />Having worked in mainstream education supporting students with special needs, it became evident that traditional classroom walls and standardized curricula fell short of meeting these students' unique requirements. The quest for alternative education practices led to exploration of Montessori, Steiner, Reggio Emilia, and, ultimately, the Forest School ethos.<br />Becoming a Level 3 Forest School Leader after immersive training, Krishna's path became clear. She began working in various settings, from establishing a Forest School from the ground up to collaborating with educational institutions. However, the pure delight of being in the forest every day, witnessing the sheer joy on children's faces, and witnessing those profound 'light bulb' moments ignited an unwavering sense of purpose.<br />Now, armed with a wealth of educational expertise, the dream of The Bee's Knees Forest School is to provide this unique joy to as many children as possible, while also ensuring that educators find true reward through their love for teaching. This vision is the culmination of a heartfelt journey dedicated to redefining the way we learn and grow.",
