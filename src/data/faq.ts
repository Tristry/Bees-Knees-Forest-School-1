        question: "What do you do when it rains and is cold?",
        answer: "When it rains and the weather turns cold, we embrace it! Our top priority is ensuring that children stay warm and dry, so they can fully enjoy our activities in any weather. While most school grounds provide natural shelter, we also have lightweight tarps and the Bee’s Knees teepee tent that we set up to shield against the wind and offer extra protection when sudden downpours occur. We've observed that with the right outdoor clothing, protection from the wind, and warm hands, children are delighted to explore the outdoors no matter the weather.\n\nAdditionally, at most of our locations, we are able to provide hot drinks during snack times to keep everyone warm on chilly days. Our team includes skilled educators who can quickly set up comfortable shelters, especially during the wettest and coldest conditions, ensuring that the children have a comfortable and enjoyable experience."

        question: "What about severe storms?",
        answer: "During severe storms that could compromise safety, we prioritise the children’s well-being. In such circumstances, we'll either return indoors and use the space to still incorporate elements of our planned activities, or in extreme weather conditions we may cancel the session and payments for the session will be fully refunded."

        question: "What happens in case of an accident?",
        answer: "In the event of an accident, our trained staff will provide immediate first aid and assess the situation. We maintain thorough accident records for transparency and safety evaluation.\nChildren who regularly play outdoors are less prone to injuries, they have a natural ability to assess risks and have a better understanding of their physical limits compared to those with less outdoor exposure.\n\nFor minor bumps, scrapes, and scratches, our educators, all of whom are trained in paediatric first aid, will care for your child. An accident report will be filled out and shared with parents. In the rare instance of a head bump, we will promptly inform parents via telephone.\n\nIn the highly unlikely event of a more serious accident, school staff will be called to site and our trained first aider educator will attend to your child while the second educator contacts medical professionals to come to the site. Parents will be immediately informed of the situation, and if necessary, we will stay with your child until you can arrive."

        question: "What clothes will the kids need?",
        answer: "Children should wear weather-appropriate clothing, including layers for warmth, waterproof outerwear, sturdy footwear, and a hat for sun protection. We recommend packing spare clothing, especially during wet weather, to keep kids comfortable throughout the day. We also provide Didriksons waterproofs that can be pre-ordered on our website at an additional cost."
